## Download: [betternarrow-main.zip](https://github.com/Laamy/betternarrow/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## How to install?
Once downloaded extract it to a safe folder. An example of how it should look like:
<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selkensy/betternarrowimages/master/Screenshot001.png">
</p>
open chrome/brave (or whatever you use) click on the three dots then go to extensions, see example:
<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selkensy/betternarrowimages/master/Screenshot002.png">
</p>
once in extensions enable developer mode (in the right corner):
<p align="center">
  <img width="25%" height="25%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selkensy/betternarrowimages/master/Screenshot005.png">
</p>
Now load the unpacked extention:
<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selkensy/betternarrowimages/master/Screenshot003.png">
</p>
Select the folder:
<p align="center">
  <img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Selkensy/betternarrowimages/master/Screenshot004.png">
</p>
And you're done! Enjoy!
